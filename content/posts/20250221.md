# DataProc cluster startup optimization

## Introduction

Cluster startup time is a crucial factor in DataProc job efficiency. When a DataProc cluster is provisioned, worker nodes are allocated from a Compute Instance pool. The provisioning time depends on machine type availability in the compute region. Larger memory machines typically take longer to provision due to lower availability in the data center.

Once provisioned, workers automatically apply the [DataProc image](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/versioning/dataproc-version-clusters), which includes Java, Scala (for Spark), and Python 3.11 with Conda. However, **no additional libraries are installed**, meaning all project dependencies must be configured before executing any job.

To streamline the startup process, the initialization script follows three key steps:

1. **OS package update** (`apt-get`)
2. **Install OS binaries** (e.g., required system dependencies)
3. **Install Python requirements**

## Optimizing dependency installation

There are multiple ways to install Python dependencies within a DataProc runtime. The choice of method significantly impacts cluster startup time.

The key options include:

- **Installing from a requirements file**
- **Installing from a built Python package**
- **Using Poetry for dependency resolution**

### Option 1: Installing from a requirements file

```bash
#!/bin/bash  

# Install required OS libraries  
apt-get update -y  
apt-get install --yes make coinor-cbc coinor-libcbc-dev libgomp1  

# Variables  
PACKAGE_BUCKET="gs://<bucket>/data"  
LOCAL_PACKAGE_DIR="/opt/app"  

# Copy the requirements file from GCS  
gsutil cp $PACKAGE_BUCKET/requirements.txt ./requirements.txt  

# Install dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Option 2: Installing from a `.whl` Package

```bash
#!/bin/bash  

# Install required OS libraries  
apt-get update -y  
apt-get install --yes make coinor-cbc coinor-libcbc-dev libgomp1  

# Variables  
PACKAGE_BUCKET="gs://<bucket>/data"  
LATEST_PACKAGE=$(gsutil ls "$PACKAGE_BUCKET/<project>-*-py3-none-any.whl" | tail -1)   
LOCAL_DIR="/opt/app"  

# Copy the package from GCS  
mkdir -p $LOCAL_DIR  
gsutil cp $LATEST_PACKAGE $LOCAL_DIR    

# Install dependencies  
cd $LOCAL_DIR  
ls -1 <project>-*-py3-none-any.whl | xargs pip install
```

### Final optimization strategy

Based on extensive testing, the most efficient approach was determined to be:

```bash
#!/bin/bash  

# Variables  
REQUIREMENTS="gs://<bucket>/data/conf/requirements.txt"  

# Copy and install dependencies  
gsutil cp $REQUIREMENTS ./requirements.txt  
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> [!NOTE]
> The [COIN-OR](https://www.coin-or.org/) installation could be removed as a version update to the data science libraries meant that they were builded inside of the Python libraries.


### Key optimizations

1. **Dropped** `apt-get` **updates**: Eliminating OS package updates significantly reduces startup time (\~3 minutes saved)
2. **Explicit Dependency Versioning**: Pre-resolving dependency versions avoids unnecessary resolution during installation.
3. **Using** `pip` **Over** `poetry` **or** `conda`: `pip` provides the fastest installation for pre-versioned dependencies.

## Python package management for DataProc

When submitting PySpark jobs, dependencies must be packaged for the Spark environment. Unlike cluster-wide dependencies installed via startup scripts, these **packages are defined at the job level**.

### Five methods for building a Python package

#### Option 1) Poetry build

With no changes to the project, call `poetry` to build a wheel using the `pyproject.toml` file.

```bash
poetry build -f wheel
```

A requirements file is still required for cluster setup. To export the dependencies:

```bash
poetry export \
    -f requirements.txt \
    --with data \
    --output requirements.txt \
    --without-hashes
```

Here we use `--with` to select the [dependency groups](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#dependencies-and-dependency-groups) that are required.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `--without-hashes` is important to build a requirements file that is OS agnostic. Otherwise a requirements file built on a Mac will not be able to resolve any matching dependencies on a Linux based CI pipeline.

#### Option 2) Use Pythonâ€™s built-in tools

Create a basic `setup.py`:

```python
import os  
from setuptools import find_packages, setup  

def read_requirements():  
    req_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "requirements.txt")  
    if os.path.exists(req_path):  
        with open(req_path) as f:  
            return f.read().splitlines()  
    return []  

setup(  
    name="<project>",  
    version="0.1.0",  
    install_requires=read_requirements(),  
    packages=find_packages(),  
)
```

With the setup file we can then build.

#### 2a) Old method (setuptools)
The traditional way of building a Python package is with the built-in `setuptools`  library. This is largely discouraged, and will show warnings on the command line when executed.

From the command line call

```bash
python setup.py sdist
```

To include the requirements file in the bundle (required for installation) requires adding the requirements file to a `MANIFEST.in` file (also at project root).

```bash
include requirements.txt
```

#### 2b) Modern python (build)
The preferred Pythonic way of building a package is using the built-in build  package.

```bash
python -m build
```

This builds both

- `<project>-0.1.0.tar.gz`
- `<project>-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`

Wheels do not include the dependencies, only references for installation.

> [!TIP]
> Wheels are better for fast installation and when there are frozen dependencies (such as a release on a production pipeline)


### Option 3) Zipping the source

DataProc supports Python code simply zipped into a .zip file. However, that .zip file still requires a top-level `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` to instruct the package manager on how to handle the install.

In this project, the `pyproject.toml` references the `README.md` file, so it also needs to be included in the bundle.

#### 3a) Zipping with the pyproject.toml

```bash
zip -r \
    dist/<project>-0.1.0-py3-none-any.zip \
    <project or src>/ \
    pyproject.toml \
    README.md
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `README.md` needs to be included in the bundle as the `pyproject.toml` makes reference to it.

#### 3b) Zipping with the setup.py
```bash
zip -r \
    dist/<project>-0.1.0-py3-none-any.zip \
    <project or src>/ \
    setup.py
```

## Bundling the dependencies in the package

Unfortunately the nature of Python is that a project inevitably ends up with a lot of dependencies. By default `pip` will install these sequentially, by querying an archive server, then downloading the package, caching it, then installing it - all over the open internet. If you are not careful with explicitly versioning each dependency pip  will also try to rebuild the entire dependency tree upon install and will slow down the startup by as much as 15 minutes per run.

In a release situation, where the dependencies are frozen and clusters are frequently spun up, it can make sense to include the dependencies within the package. The (larger) package is then copied once from Cloud Storage to the Composer file system once and everything is installed without any calls to the internet.

The only complication is that the bundled dependencies need to exactly match the target run time. i.e. building a package on a Mac will pull Mac compiled dependencies and will not run on a Linux server.

### Pull the Docker image

Jump into a (Debian) Linux based Docker image, ideally one that matches the Python version on the DataProc cluster

```bash
docker pull python:3.11-slim
```

With the image downloaded, create and connect to an interactive session with the image. Note to connect with bash and not the Python command interface

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app python:3.11-slim bash
```

Where,

- `$(pwd):/app`: Mounts your current directory (pwd) to /app in the container.
- `-w /app`: Sets the working directory inside the container to /app.

### Install dependencies to a target directory

From the container, install the requirements and save the cache

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --target ./vendor
```

This will then pull the exact requirement binary versions for Linux and store them in the `vendor` directory.

Again, we zip the project code, this time include the dependencies

```bash
zip -r \
    dist/<project>-0.1.0-py3-none-any.zip
    <project or src>/ \
    vendor/ \       # include dependencies
    pyproject.toml \
    README.md
```

> [!WARNING]
> For this project the ZIP size went from ~80KB to 468MB with the usual data science libraries.

However, this should save a lot of time on installation, as there is no resolution required from `pip`, and there should be no network latency.

## Benchmarking cluster initialization

To determine the optimal approach, a benchmarking exercise was conducted to compare different formats, dependency resolutions, and build systems.

### Key takeaways

#### 1) `.whl` is the most performant file format
`.whl`'s were the most performant.

`.zip`'s were the second best. Curiously, taking a `.whl` file and renaming it to a .zip almost doubled the cluster initialization.

`.tar.gz` was by far the worst format and more than 5x the install time before the cluster timed out.

#### 2) Versioned dependencies vastly increase install speed
Explicit versioning saved approx. 30% of cluster initialization time across file formats.

Of course, the version resolution needs to be added to the deployment pipeline - but this only runs once per release, but saves resolution every time a job is submitted.

#### 3) Bundling the dependencies yields no real benefit
It was theorized that, as GCS and DataProc would be in the same data centre, moving a larger package internally would be faster than looking up and pulling ~100 libraries across the open internet. This was not the case. It might be that the DataProc service is providing a certain amount of caching of common libraries, or that pip  can multithread the fetch and install of packages from the internet, but not locally.

#### 4) `pyproject.toml` performs slightly better than `setup.py`
Not a significant difference, but avoiding a legacy build system that is warned against and will be shortly deprecated makes sense - further it would pollute the project top level directory with more files.

#### 5) Modern build systems produce more performant builds
At first glance, the packages built by `sdist`, build and poetry appear identical - however, there are slight differences which affect their handling by the package manager at install. The new systems install slightly faster.

#### 6) Larger jobs are more performant than increasing parallelization
Given that the package install has to occur every time a job is submitted to a Spark cluster worker, care should be taken to balance number of jobs with job size. From this investigation, increasing a job length by 5 minutes would be far more beneficial than creating a new job to do the same work.

For this reason, larger worker nodes utilizing a multithread approach would likely yield the best outcomes.
