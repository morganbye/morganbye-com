Last year, having made an effort of [migrating the blog](https://morganbye.com/posts/20231220/) (again), I'd read through a lot of my old blog posts - particular those end of year summaries. As a result, I made a concerted effort to [sit down at the end of 2023](https://morganbye.com/posts/20240131_1/) and make my way through a template that I drew up / lifted / pilfered.

Little did I know, that the whole thing would become a bit of a thing, and ended up taking me the best part of a month to cover every section that I wanted. And actually, I didn't cover every topic I wanted - I just ended up pulling the trigger on publish at some point.

It turned out that once I sat down to write, each section ended up being a multi-part essay - and I ended up splitting it into 5 sections when it came to post it all on the website.

But I'm glad I did it. I'm glad that I have a time capsule into my thoughts and feelings that I was experiencing at the time. My hope now with this review is to just write. Get down a stream of conciousness as raw and unfiltered as possible. Then perhaps towards the end of January with a little period to mentally detach from one's own writing, I'll compare my 2023 review to 2024 and set about seeing what went well, what didn't go so well and what was a complete failure. To that end, maybe I'll learn something, and maybe I'll be able to better goal-set into 2025.
