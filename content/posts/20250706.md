It was supposed to be a success story.

I did the impossible - again. This time an entire agentic LLM workflow, test harness, evaluation framework... Which of course are mere hand-wavy details for a non-technical client that loves a pretty, little web app.

I demoed the thing to the client. They were impressed. The imperceptible nod of approval. An executive gave their highest praise “*Can’t wait to see where this goes.*”

It was the hardest thing I’ve ever worked on. The most complicated. The most stressful. I finished it. I should’ve felt… something.

Then I exhaled.

For the first time in six weeks I felt my body _let go_. Like a gazelle watching the lion finally give up the chase. We'd survived. Just barely.

My shoulders dropped. My muscles slowly loosened their vice-like grip on knots of tension. My inner monologue replaced with a high-pitched whine, as my nervous system tingled with the crackling energy of the power grid collapsing.

And then… nothing.

No rush.  
No pride.  
No catharsis.  
Just an eerie stillness.  
A void where the high was supposed to be.

Internally, the praise was lavished “_Thanks again for jumping in on this._”

For over a month I’ve been clocking 80 hours a week of hands-on-keyboard time. Stopping only to eat. Falling asleep in design patterns. Dreaming in IF statements.

GitHub helpfully quantifies my insanity to the tune of 15,000 lines of code per week. That sounds impossible until you realize the alternative - failure.

The only thing stood between embarrassment and humiliation was me.

There was no one else. No one else who understood the pieces. Just me and the creeping realization that this entire thing would succeed - or collapse - based on whether I was willing to risk placing my sanity on the sacrificial slab and become a martyr of output.

I was.

That's the job. I fix the impossible. I deliver. I signed up for this.

That's what I convinced myself the job required.

The demo went well. The client smiled.

I stopped sharing my screen and thanked whatever merciful Gods had smiled upon me, as I left the sales team to bring it home, with their "insights" slides - which I'd only finished 10 minutes before the presentation and had to beg them to review before the call.

Somewhere between “impressive” and “game-changing,” === In the intro, we said the client only said "let's see where it goes" === my brain faded away into white noise. Continuing to stay upright only by caffeine levels sufficient to keep a {long-haul trucker on the road for 18 hours.} === dont like this metaphor, like a horse... ===

The internal response was… quiet. Grateful, but transactional. The kind of thumbs up you give someone who brings doughnuts to the office, not someone who just held up a crumbling cathedral with their bare hands for a month.

I don’t blame anyone for that. No one’s done anything _wrong_.

I just did it too well.

That’s the curse, isn’t it? When you succeed completely, there’s nothing left to fix. No crisis. No drama. No “we couldn’t have done it without you” - because now it looks like we always could.

You feel like the fire fighter that's just crawled on their belly through burning hot misery to save the baby.

Invisible labor scales beautifully. Right up until you realize you’ve disappeared entirely.

---

I keep thinking I should feel something. Relief? Pride? But all I feel is dread.

Not the sharp, anxious kind. The slow, structural kind. The kind you feel when you realize this is who you are now. You can never go back to the person you were.

This wasn’t a one-time heroic push. This was just another chapter in the ongoing biography of _the person who gets it done._

---

It’s not burnout. I’ve been there. Burnout is fire and collapse. This is something else.

This is standing at the summit of a mountain you didn’t mean to climb, staring out at a horizon of more mountains, and realizing no one’s coming to meet you. No one even knew you were up here.

And the worst part?

If someone asked me to do it again next week… I'm not sure if I could say no. How could I, if all I am is someone who climbs?

I wish I had written about success last week. Before the demo. Before the drop. I wanted to write about the Cassandra-to-Atlas arc. About how “Mission: Impossible” had become my modus operandi. About the slow, quiet process of becoming the person who always says yes - who just fixes it.

But that version of me is gone now. He shipped. What’s left is me, sitting in the echo of an applause that will never come, wondering what the hell just happened.

Maybe this is what high-functioning anxious overachievers look like running on fumes.

Maybe this is what success feels like when you’ve made it look *too* easy.

Maybe this is what broken looks like… but that dashboard - all green.
