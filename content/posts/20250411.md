There’s a common misconception in the industry that consultants are expensive. This is, of course, false.

Consultants are *not* expensive. Not nearly expensive enough.

You see, the goal of a consultant is to be a *10x engineer*. Not in the sense of writing ten times more code, or moving ten times as many Jira tickets.

No, the real goal is to make your team *feel* ten times more productive simply by being around. To dramatically whoosh into a room, say something profound, yet slightly confusing, then disappear into the mist before anyone asks a follow-up question.

This kind of talent isn’t just valuable — it’s *transcendent*. Who else, 5 minutes into a site visit, is going to look you square in the eye and say, "*All of this is stupid*."?

### Consultants shouldn’t be hired to do work

Let’s be clear: consultants are not supposed to do work. That’s for employees. The whole point of hiring a consultant is that your team is too busy, too entrenched, or too misaligned to solve their own problems — or worse, they don’t even *recognize* their own problems.

Consultants are the Schrödinger’s cat of value delivery: they simultaneously do everything and nothing. And the second you try to observe it, the spell breaks.

---

### Consulting should feel sacred

Every delivery from a consultant should be accompanied by a *Gregorian chant* and at least three ceremonial PowerPoint transitions. You shouldn’t *receive* a deliverable. You should *witness* it.

Your team should feel the need to avert their eyes.

---

### Consultants should be trained like spies

Consultants should be trained in evasion, deception, and high-speed exits.

They should be able to:

- Disappear from meetings whilst "*taking things offline*" leaving behind only action items
- Maintain an aura of authority while saying absolutely nothing specific
- Use phrases like "*industry best practice*", "*synergies*" or "*strategic alignment*" as smokescreens to commitments

Of course, consultants should be paid like world-class athletes. — because they *are* elite performers. Their contracts should require biometric checks, retina scans, and at least one ceremonial sacrifice to the business gods before engagement.

---

### You shouldn’t be able to summon a consultant

Access should be restricted. Consultants should be impossible to contact unless you know the correct public payphone to leave the sacrificial whiteboard marker.

You don’t just *email* a consultant. You summon them. You schedule a consultation via messenger pigeon or whisper it into a conch shell during the new moon.

Once a consultant is engaged, their time should be tracked in 30-second increments and invoiced in carbon credits. Any cancellation within a 48-hour window resulting in a mandatory LinkedIn endorsement.

---

### Everything should feel bespoke

Consultants shouldn’t do slide decks. They should deliver artefacts — hand-stitched, artisanal strategies embedded in mahogany cases, with a proprietary font that costs $800 per vowel.

Your team should look at their work and think: “*Wow. We can never afford this again.*”

Because that’s the point.

Consultants exist not to do what you can do, but to remind you of what you *could* be — in a vague, abstract way that cannot be implemented without another consultant.
