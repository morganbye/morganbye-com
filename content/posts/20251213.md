Just do the thing. Just start. Stop reading. Go do it. Do it now.

Talking about the thing *is not doing the thing.*

Reading the docs *is not doing the thing.*

Collecting more specifications *is not doing the thing.*

Writing a design doc *is not doing the thing.*

Building a detailed roadmap *is not doing the thing.*

Crafting beautiful Jira tickets *is not doing the thing.*

Having meetings about the thing *is not doing the thing.*

Having a pre-meeting to align on the agenda for the meeting *is not doing the thing.*

Getting alignment from stakeholders *is not doing the thing.*

Building dashboards to monitor the thing *is not doing the thing.*

You’re not blocked.  
You’re procrastinating.

Just. Do. The. Thing.
