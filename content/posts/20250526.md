## Our business is unique

Here at **_SynergetIQ_**, we believe in innovation, synergy, and the kind of efficiency that requires at least three middle managers to define. Our customers are visionary thought-leaders, and so are we. That’s why we refuse to use software that hasn’t been manically optimized and surgically grafted onto our unique, ever-shifting business needs.

So when the VP of Sales announced we needed a new CRM—one that could support:

- Nested lead scoring,
- Timezone-aware Slack notifications,
- Steve’s spreadsheet (non-negotiable),
- **_And_** work flawlessly on an iPad 2...

...we knew: *this* was a job for a ***custom*** solution.

> “_We’re not like other companies,_” said our CEO, with the quiet confidence of a man who once tried to run payroll through Mailchimp.

We briefly considered building in-house. But after someone did the math, then came one HR complaint about "*developer tears not being a valid KPI,*" and a team rage-quitting a vendor demo 14 minutes into a 30-day trial… we pivoted.

Thanks to some exceptional dealmaking by our CIO on the 16th green, we bought an off-the-shelf platform.

> “*I clicked one button and now I’m locked out of Q3,*” said Shelly from Accounting. “*There’s an icon that looks like a flamingo, but apparently that deletes everything.*”

Steve, meanwhile, just quietly smiled to himself.
His macros had survived the Windows 7 migration.

## The light touch

> “*We’ll just customize it a little,*” they said.

Just enough to make it ours.

It began innocently enough: a renamed button here, a few new dropdown values there. Nothing too serious - just enough so that teams could "*maintain continuity with our legacy workflows,*" a phrase we later discovered meant "*still use Steve's spreadsheet.*"

But then Product wanted color-coded tagging that matched their mood board.

Marketing insisted on emoji reactions in the CRM notes field - strictly from the 2017 Unicode set, “*for brand consistency.*”

Legal required every record to be exportable as a PDF, then immediately encrypted and password-protected, while Finance requested a secure audit trail with support for fiscal calendars based on the Mayan long count.

By the end of Q2, the system had:

- A custom plugin that translated comments into pirate-speak every September

- An internal chatbot named _Workflow Wendy_ who, after sufficiently completing all necessary paperwork, went on maternity leave

- A calendar integration that synced with Outlook, Google, and our CEO’s PalmPilot (which he insists is "*more ergonomic*")

The vendor dropped support and then went mysteriously missing during a kayaking incident.

Soon ***out of the box*** meant a team of six developers living out of an actual cardboard box inside of the data center.


## The Monolith awakens

By Q3, the system was no longer a tool - it was an ecosystem. Bugs were mature enough to have evolved legs, crawled primordial ooze and sent their kids to college. A sacred labyrinth of checkboxes, hidden dropdowns, and dependencies so old they were last backed up to Zip disk.

No one knew *how* our “**turnkey solution**” actually worked. Not even the team that built it.

All we know is there’s a 1998 Compaq laptop running Windows XP in the server room that the infra team are too scared to move *onto* the UPS.

Yes, the system is slow. Yes, onboarding takes two weeks, a whiteboard session, and a whispered legend passed down by Operations.
But our customer satisfaction scores?
All green.

Now running a simple email campaign was as simple as:

- Ensuring the Global Elite ServiceNow subscription hadn't expired
- Wait 22 minutes for the dashboard to load
- Remembering the dashboard's only accurate on Thursdays
- Adding each client to the template spreadsheet `Q4_FINAL_FinalACTUAL_use_this_one_v3`
- Wait for *Workflow Wendy’s* out-of-office autoresponder to forward it to an internal inbox named `crmtickets_butreal`
- Receive final approval from Steve - **non-negotiable**

And if something broke, we logged a ticket, held our breath, and hoped it wouldn’t reach Steve during a long weekend.


## Rebirth

Eventually, something snapped. Possibly the infrastructure team.

The CTO left. A new CIO arrived, wielding fresh credentials, inspirational haikus and a deep distrust of anything old enough to support plugins.

She spoke of simplicity. Of clarity. Of streamlining.

“We need a system,” she said, “that reflects how we *really* work. That adapts to us. Not the other way around.”

> “*This time, we’ll build it right*,” she declared.
>
> “*From scratch.*
>
> *With AI.*”

A quiet shiver ran through the dev team.

Steve updated his résumé.
