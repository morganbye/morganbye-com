I was recently going back through my blog over the years, and I read through my annual review of 2010. It was quite an enlightening little snapshot into my life at the time. A reflection of all that was important to me in that moment, and where I saw myself going into the new year.

I instantly regretted not sticking with the tradition and keeping a little time capsule for all the years in-between.

This year, I'm committing to writing a comprehensive review, but to do so I've structured myself a little template of sections of areas that I think are important to cover. If it works well, then maybe this will be a format for years to come. If it doesn't, then I'll iterate into something else next time around. Lord knows, it cant be any worse than the suggestion that ChatGPT came up with.
