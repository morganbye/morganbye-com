Returning for my third year of self-reflection in *this incarnation* of the blog, is the 2025 annual review. As with previous year's, I'm using [Chris Williamson's template](https://chriswillx.com/review/) as inspiration and customizing it as we go.

## Rapid fire, best of

**Best Surprise**  
Having words from my blog quoted back to me

**Best Meal**  
[Beef Wellington](https://www.instagram.com/bargeorgemtl/p/DSDijtfD2p2/) at [Bar George](https://www.bargeorge.ca/) for my birthday

**Coolest New Experience**  
Training with a training plan, and first time training with a power meter - it really does change the game. But sea kayaks up a fjord was a pretty close second.

**Favourite Weekend**  
A weekend in Ottawa with the family, there was dinosaurs, airplanes and monster trucks

**Favourite First Meeting**  
A reference check for a mentee with a local CTO.

Was it an amazing meeting? No. Talked again since? Also no. But those 20 minutes started months of self-reflection.

**Favourite New City**  
Ottawa, capital of Canada

**Favourite New Walk**  
Parc national des Hautes-Gorges, QC

**Favourite New Friend**  
No one knew really entered my life this year, instead I've been really doubling down on existing connections.

**Favourite Tour**  
Saguenay Fjord National Park, QC

**Most Intense Week**  
Delivering an entire LLM project solo - it led to some of my [best reflective writing](https://morganbye.com/posts/the_fixer/) of the year.

**Favourite Artist**  
Sleep Token

**Favourite Song**  
*Caramel* by *Sleep Token*  
[{{< fa fab youtube >}}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iSvoQNfrrk) [{{< fa fab spotify >}}](https://open.spotify.com/track/1QrbZhFYlViXd60g130vw1?si=eabed7ebb6bd4c75)

**Favourite Album**  
*A Long Lost Silence* by *There's a Light*  
[{{< fa fab youtube >}}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EG3Sqekiiw)  [{{< fa fab bandcamp >}}](https://theresalight.bandcamp.com/album/a-long-lost-silence)  [{{< fa fab spotify >}}](https://open.spotify.com/album/49VKcJU1siwrXQOwfcs9G9)

There's a soft-spot in my heart for atmospheric, melancholy post-rock. This album answers everything I've been looking for since I first found Sigur Ros.

**Favourite Concert**  
Streetlight Manifesto, though it was great to see Black Rebel Motorcycle Club again after all these years

**Favourite Quote**  
They'll ask why I didn't swim harder
