### üìà **The Business Challenge**

Promotions represent nearly 50% of unit sales and 40% of revenue in grocery retail, yet many chains rely on repeating the same promotions year after year ‚Äî often applying identical prices across vastly different stores. This blunt approach ignores local demand elasticity, leading to margin loss, supply chain inefficiencies, and missed growth opportunities.

One of Canada‚Äôs largest grocery retailers, sought to modernize its promotional pricing strategy by integrating advanced AI and optimization models. The goal: create store-level price differentiation and optimize promotion plans to drive revenue and margin improvements while reducing waste across 1,000+ stores.

### üß© **Our Approach**

As technical lead on the project, I oversaw the design and development of a modular AI-driven solution capable of:

- Clustering stores based on historical sales, price sensitivity and demographics
- Recommending optimal price points **per cluster** for unadvertised promotions
- Scaling to generate full **quarter promotional schedules** while respecting business constraints

Our hybrid approach combined machine learning, mathematical optimization, and simulation:
- **Demand prediction models** forecasted store-level sales at various price points
- **Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP)** formulations optimized both pricing and store clustering
- **Custom simulators** validated financial and operational impacts before deployment
