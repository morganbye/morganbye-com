title: Predictive maintenance at Boeing
description: Boeing's Flight Data Analytics platform is built to handle recorded flight data from tens of thousands of flights along with other contextual data sources. The first application on this platform was Insight Accelerator, which allows for the building of predicitive maintenance - servicing the aircraft *before* failures occur.

[Insight Accelerator](https://services.boeing.com/flight-operations/flight-data-analytics/insight-accelerator) is a first-of-its-kind predictive maintenance solution that provides powerful advanced analytics and customized alerting – all in an easy-to-use tool. By analyzing full flight data from thousands of onboard sensors, users can derive prognostic insights and create alerting algorithms unique to each airline’s operation.

Harness the power of built-in augmented analytics to identify patterns of premature component failure to pre-emptively perform maintenance and avoid the high impacts of unwanted disruptions – all without needing data science or advanced programming skills.

In one instance during the beta testing, an aircraft's captain called via satellite phone that a major subsystem had gone down on the plane, mid-Atlantic. We rapidly onboarded the aircraft to the beta test, applied our in-house algorithms and identified which unit had failed. By the time the aircraft landed in New York, the spare part had already been sourced and sent to the tarmac. The repair was conducted as the aircraft was turned around, and ultimately departed on-time with no delay or interference to the schedule.
