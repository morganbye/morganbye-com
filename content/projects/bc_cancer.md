All cells have genomes (DNA genetic codes) that govern their existence. Cancer occurs when the genomes of cells change, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and replication.

The Personalized Onco-Genomics (POG) Program is BC Cancer’s flagship study in precision medicine and the first program of its kind to deploy whole genome analysis to inform individual treatment planning for patients.

For each patient, 2 samples are taken, one of "normal" cells, and one from the cancer. The sequences are then compared in an effort to find variations and mutations between the two which represent the cancer.

To date[^1], 1,376 patients (including over 100 children) have been enrolled into the POG project. **86% yielded results that were deemed “actionable” by the clinical team**, meaning the results directed affected the choice of treatment by the clinician and patient.
